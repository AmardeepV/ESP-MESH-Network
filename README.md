# ESP-MESH-Network


ESP-MESH reduces the loading of smart light devices on the router by forming a mesh with the smart light device. In a mesh network, the nodes can establish a network and forward packets. As a result, a large number of nodes can connect to the Internet without any improvements to the current router.
